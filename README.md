## What is Text_Repeat?
Text_Repeat is a simple software which allows you to send messages(currently over WhatsApp Web) in bulk to the sender in your contact list. Currently supporting Windows (because it is easy to work with).

----
## Why the need?
Text_Repeat is a simple software made with Python. Few of my friends have boyfriends/girlfriends and as relationship goals are, you will have a fight that will test the compatibility of one another. This usually results in one having to make amends. This program, which I made upon their request, should help them to send bulk messages to another, in a hope that crack doesn't extend further.

This program can be used by best of friends to prank one another. Just try to be ethical. Don't continue sending bulk messages if the recipient have an ageing phone.

Now a **Disclaimer**
1. Don't cry if your best friend blocked you as you didn't knew when to stop.
2. I am not responsible if the recipient breaks your phone or bones.
3. Don't try on your crushes, seriously never try.

----
## Why the Underscore?
Because I am an avid Watch_Dogs fan, so you get the idea.

## Usage

2. Unzip it (LOL).
